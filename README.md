The repository contains various network simulation projects and configurations that can be easily downloaded and imported into Packet Tracer.

# Introduction 


# Task 5 :Configure EIGRP and OSPF routing in the below topology.
EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) are two popular routing protocols used in computer networks to facilitate communication between network devices.

EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, while OSPF is an open standard protocol. EIGRP uses a hybrid routing protocol that combines features of both distance vector and link-state routing protocols. OSPF, on the other hand, is a pure link-state protocol.

One of the key differences between EIGRP and OSPF is how they calculate the best path to a destination. EIGRP uses a composite metric that takes into account factors such as bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load, while OSPF uses a cost-based metric that is calculated based on the bandwidth of the links.

Another difference is that EIGRP is considered to be easier to configure and manage than OSPF. EIGRP also supports different network topologies, including hub-and-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh, while OSPF is better suited for larger networks with complex topologies.

Overall, the choice between EIGRP and OSPF depends on the specific needs and requirements of the network. Both protocols have their strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should be made based on factors such as the size of the network, the topology, the level of complexity, and the hardware and software requirements.
