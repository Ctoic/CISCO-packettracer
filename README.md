# CISCO-packettracer
This GitHub repository is dedicated to Packet Tracer network simulations, which are used to practice, learn, and test networking concepts in a virtual environment. The repository contains various network simulation projects and configurations that can be easily downloaded and imported into Packet Tracer.

# Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Packet Tracer from the Cisco Networking Academy website.

Once you have installed Packet Tracer, you can explore the contents of this repository. The repository contains a number of directories, each of which contains resources related to a specific topic.

# Directories
The following directories are included in this repository:

sample-topologies: This directory contains a set of sample network topologies that you can use to explore Packet Tracer. Each topology is provided as a Packet Tracer file and a PDF document that explains the topology and provides instructions for exploring it.

scripts: This directory contains a set of scripts that you can use to automate common tasks in Packet Tracer. The scripts are written in Python and can be run from the command line.

documentation: This directory contains a set of documents that provide information on using Packet Tracer. The documents include user guides, tutorials, and reference materials.

# Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a Packet Tracer resource that you would like to share, please create a pull request with your changes.

# Task 5 :Configure EIGRP and OSPF routing in the below topology.
EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) are two popular routing protocols used in computer networks to facilitate communication between network devices.

EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, while OSPF is an open standard protocol. EIGRP uses a hybrid routing protocol that combines features of both distance vector and link-state routing protocols. OSPF, on the other hand, is a pure link-state protocol.

One of the key differences between EIGRP and OSPF is how they calculate the best path to a destination. EIGRP uses a composite metric that takes into account factors such as bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load, while OSPF uses a cost-based metric that is calculated based on the bandwidth of the links.

Another difference is that EIGRP is considered to be easier to configure and manage than OSPF. EIGRP also supports different network topologies, including hub-and-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh, while OSPF is better suited for larger networks with complex topologies.

Overall, the choice between EIGRP and OSPF depends on the specific needs and requirements of the network. Both protocols have their strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should be made based on factors such as the size of the network, the topology, the level of complexity, and the hardware and software requirements.
